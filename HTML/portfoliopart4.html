          <h3>How to Become EMR Certified:</h3>
          <ol>
              <li> <strong> <em> Enroll in an education program. </em> </strong> To apply for EMR certification, you must be enrolled in an education program. Different states have different requirements, but an EMR program typically requires 2–4 weeks to complete with about 55–65 hours of instruction.</li>
              <li> <strong> <em> Register for the EMR exam. </em> </strong> Once you are enrolled in an EMR education program, create your account with the National Registry. About four weeks before you complete your education program, you should submit your application to the National Registry. To be authorized to take the cognitive EMR exam, you will need to submit your approved application, payment, and your Program Director’s approval. </li>
              <li> <strong> <em> Pass the EMR cognitive exam.  </em> </strong> You will take the cognitive exam on a computer at an authorized testing center. Your exam will consist of between 90 and 110 multiple-choice questions. 30 of those questions will not affect your score. </li>
          </ol>
          <ul>
              <li> <strong> <em> The EMR cognitive exam covers the following areas: </em> </strong> </li>
              <li>Airway, Respiration & Ventilation (18%–22%)</li>
              <li>Cardiology & Resuscitation (20%–24%)</li>
              <li>Trauma (15%–19%)</li>
              <li>Medical; Obstetrics & Gynecology (27%–31%)</li>
              <li>EMS Operations (11%–15%)</li>
              <li>Among the questions related to patient care, 85% are focused on adult and geriatric patients, and 15% are about pediatric patients.</li>
              <li>If you do not pass the cognitive exam, the National Registry will provide feedback on your test, and you may apply to retest 15 days after the last examination.</li>
          </ul>
          <ol start="4">
              <li> <strong> <em> Pass the EMR psychomotor exam. </em> </strong> The National Registry does not administer EMR psychomotor examinations. All EMR psychomotor exams are administered by either the State EMS Office or at the training institution (with approval of the State EMS Office). Your EMR course instructor should provide you information about this examination. The following performance checklists (from the National Registry) are a guide for verifying required skills. The State EMS Office or training institution may use different forms. </li>
