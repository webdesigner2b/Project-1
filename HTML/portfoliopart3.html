    <tr>
        <td>Emergency Medical Responders</td> <td> Certified EMRs are qualified and authorized to administer life-saving techniques like CPR and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation while waiting for more qualified medical professionals to arrive. EMRs can also provide assistance to other medical professionals at the scene of an emergency or during transport.

            An EMR’s scope of practice includes simple, non-invasive interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with acute out-of-hospital medical and traumatic emergencies. Emergency care is based on assessment findings. EMRs also provide care designed to minimize the chances of secondary injury and comfort the patient and family while awaiting additional EMS resources.</td>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Emergency Medical Technicians</td> <td>Certified EMTs are qualified and authorized to stabilize and safely transport patients for all calls from routine transports to life-threatening emergencies.

            An EMT’s scope of practice includes basic, non-invasive interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with acute out-of-hospital medical and traumatic emergencies. Emergency care is based on assessment findings. EMTs can also provide care to minimize secondary injury and provide comfort to the patient and family while transporting the patient to an emergency care facility.
            
            EMT is the minimum licensure level for personnel transporting patients in ambulances. The scope of practice is limited to basic skills that are effective and can be performed safely in an out-of-hospital setting with medical oversight and limited training.</td>

        <th>AEMT's</th> <th>Their Responsibilities</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians</td> <td>Advanced Emergency Medical Technicians (AEMTs) are qualified and authorized to provide the same services as an EMT and administer fluids and some medications, and use the advanced medical equipment carried in the ambulance.

            An EMT’s scope of practice includes basic, limited advanced, and pharmacological interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with acute out-of-hospital medical and traumatic emergencies. Emergency care is based on assessment findings. AEMTs also provide care to minimize secondary injury and provide comfort to the patient and family while transporting the patient to an emergency care facility.
            
            The major difference between the Advanced Emergency Medical Technician and the Emergency Medical Technician is the ability to perform limited advanced skills and provide pharmacological interventions to emergency patients.
            
            AEMT is the minimum licensure level to provide limited advanced care to patients at the scene or during transportation. The scope of practice model is limited to lower risk. These high-benefit advanced skills are effective and can be performed safely in an out-of-hospital setting with medical oversight and limited training.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Paramedics</th> <th>Their Responsibilities</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Highest Level of EMS</td> <td>Paramedics provide advanced medical care for critical and emergent patients in the EMS system. Paramedics have the largest range of job duties, including, but not limited to, all duties of lower-level EMTs, reading labs, EKGs, and X-rays, and manual defibrillation.

            A paramedic’s scope of practice includes invasive and pharmacological interventions to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with acute out-of-hospital medical and traumatic emergencies. Emergency care is based on an advanced assessment and the formulation of a field impression. The paramedic provides care designed to minimize secondary injury and provide comfort to the patient and family while transporting the patient to an appropriate health care facility.
            
            A paramedic has the knowledge associated with the EMR, EMT, and AEMT. The major difference between the paramedic and the advanced emergency medical technician is the ability to perform a broader range of advanced skills. These skills carry greater risk for the patient if improperly or inappropriately performed, are more challenging to attain and maintain competency in, and require significant background knowledge in basic and applied sciences.
            
            Paramedic is the minimum licensure level for patients requiring the full range of advanced out-of-hospital care. The scope of practice is limited to advanced skills that are effective and can be performed safely in an out-of-hospital setting with medical oversight.</td>
